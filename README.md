✅ *Python Project 3: Number Guessing Game 🎯*  

📌 *Problem Statement:*  
Build a CLI game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

🧠 *What You'll Learn:*  
- Using `random` module  
- Conditional logic  
- Loops & user input  
- Feedback system in games  

✅ *Python Code:*  
``` 
import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 7

print("🎲 Guess the Number (1 to 100)")

while attempts < max_attempts:
    try:
        guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempts+1}: Enter your guess: "))
        attempts += 1

        if guess == number:
            print("🎉 Correct! You guessed it.")
            break
        elif guess < number:
            print("📉 Too low!")
        else:
            print("📈 Too high!")

    except ValueError:
        print("❌ Please enter a valid number.")

if attempts == max_attempts and guess != number:
    print(f"😢 Out of attempts! The number was {number}.")
```

📥 *Sample Interaction:*  
```
Attempt 1: Enter your guess: 45  
📉 Too low!  
...  
🎉 Correct! You guessed it.
```
